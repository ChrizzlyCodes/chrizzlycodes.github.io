# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first test.

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
        z = np.sum(x, y)

        return z
```

```cs
for (int i = 0 ; i < 10; i++)
{
    // Code to execute.
}
```

Boop

Some LaTeX-Style equations

$$z = x + y $$

And some inline equations $$z = x + y $$ coming right up.
